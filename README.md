# **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Learning Journey** 🚀

## 🎯 **Repository Purpose**
This repository documents my hands-on exploration of **Computer Engineering concepts** using the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Instead of just reading theory, I'm learning by doing experiments that reveal how computers actually work at the hardware level.

## 📋 **What's Inside**
- **Hands-on labs** connecting theory to practice
- **Real measurements** from actual hardware
- **Step-by-step guides** for beginners
- **Visual explanations** of computer architecture concepts

## 🛠️ **Hardware Setup**
- **Board**: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- **CPU**: ARM Cortex-A53 (quad-core 1GHz)
- **RAM**: 512MB
- **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (headless)
- **Learning Style**: SSH terminal only - no GUI distractions!

## 🧠 **Learning Path**
1. **Fundamentals**: Basic Linux, compiling programs, system monitoring
2. **CPU Architecture**: Understanding cores, clock speed, instruction execution
3. **Memory Hierarchy**: Cache vs RAM, performance implications
4. **Assembly Language**: From C code to machine instructions
5. **Performance Analysis**: Measuring and optimizing real programs

## 🎓 **Why This Approach?**
As a Computer Engineering student, I believe:
- **Theory + Practice = Understanding**
- Small experiments > memorizing textbooks
- The Pi Zero 2 W is the perfect lab tool - affordable, capable, and transparent
